          <p> The Sparks Old Age Home helps Elderly people to live with joy in their lives and persue their dreams and keeps them engaged in various activities.<br>
            Our Main focus is to help all the elderly people in need of shelter or love . <br>
            In the good old days people used to love their parents and take care of them. Now-a-days with the busy life of people they feel that parents are a burden on them.
            That they have to take care of their parents and then they decide to let their parents live in old age homes. These people have forgotten what their parents
            sacrificed for them to make them who they are today and when the time came to take care of them , they thought our parents are a burden of us .
            All your parents parents need is some words of love and affection . For this we are here to take care of all the elderly people who need love and affection.
            <br>
            We have a capacity of 300 people in our old age home with an area of 16500 sq.ft and 2 bed sufficiently furnished rooms for the people.</p></div>
